# Codesphere Coding Contest Submission Countdown App

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project! It served as an engaging opportunity to not only refresh my React skills but also fueled my enthusiasm to delve into more coding contests. This repository represents one of my submissions, and my primary focus was on crafting a countdown app that not only meets the functional requirements but also prioritizes excellent usability and customizability.

## Usage

1. Go to https://47973-3000.2.codesphere.com/
2. Click at the elements you want to customize
3. Click on the background to change the background image (Some clicks might only pick up at the lower half of the screen)
4. Have fun sharing your countdown

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Design and Animations

Assess the aesthetic appeal and quality of animations in the component. Evaluate the visual design, color schemes, and the smoothness of animations.

### 2. Functional Accuracy and Reliability

Evaluate how well the component performs its intended functions and its overall reliability. Ensure that the countdown accurately reflects the time remaining until the coding contest and that it operates smoothly without errors.

### 3. Code Quality and Structure

Review the organization and quality of the code. This includes assessing code readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Check for proper documentation and comments to aid understanding.

### 4. User-Friendliness and Interactivity

Analyze the user-friendliness of the component and the level of interactivity it offers to users. Ensure that users can easily customize the countdown, and assess the overall user experience.

## Personal Requirements for the project

- **Ease of use**: Users should be able to effortlessly create, customize, and share their countdowns with an intuitive interface.
- **Extendability**: The codebase should be structured to facilitate a high degree of flexibility and extendability, allowing for future enhancements.
- **UI Design**: Given that a substantial portion of the UI is user-customized, persistent elements like the toolbar must maintain a clean and uncluttered appearance.
- **No Backend**: A deliberate decision was made to forgo a backend service for storing settings. This choice is underpinned by the appeal of leveraging URLParams, offering potent capabilities when employed judiciously.
- **Sharing Countdowns**: Effortless sharing of personalized countdowns with friends and family should be a seamless feature.
- **Refreshing React Skills**: This project serves as an excellent opportunity to reacquaint myself with React, rekindling and enhancing my proficiency in the framework after a hiatus.

## Features

### Completed
